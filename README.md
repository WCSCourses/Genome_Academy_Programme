# About

Genomics is a rapidly developing field of research. It is increasingly weaving its way into everyday life, from playing a role in vaccine development, virus tracking, personalised cancer treatments, unveiling family histories, solving crime, to tackling the planet’s fragile ecosystems. There are a wide range of career opportunities in this field, some that didn’t even exist several years ago. Across three immersive days, you will learn and experience the end-to-end process of how we translate DNA into data.

The packed programme of activities will include, talks on the latest cutting-edge science taking place at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, lab tours, hands-on experiences with wet lab techniques, such as DNA Extraction, PCR, and DNA sequencing, as well as training with bioinformatics tools. You will also get the opportunity to meet a range of different staff working in genomics.

# Who is the Genome Academy for?
The Genome Academy is open to year 12 students who are interested in working in the field of biomedical research.
